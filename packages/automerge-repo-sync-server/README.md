# Automerge-Repo Sync Server

A very simple automerge-repo synchronization server. It pairs with the websocket client protocol found in `automerge-repo-network-websocket`.

It wraps those things in an unsecured `express` app. This isn't a great way to operate (or the only way) but it's a useful demonstration of what a client/server deployment might look like.

## Running sync-server

`yarn start`

Good luck. You're gonna need it.
